name: Release dotenvify

# This workflow will build and release the dotenvify CLI tool
# It triggers when a tag matching v*.*.* is pushed to the repository
# Note: GoReleaser requires strict semantic versioning (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
# Tags like v0.1.3.1 are not valid and will cause the release to fail
